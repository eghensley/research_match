Predator activity can influence prey distribution, abundance, and foraging behaviors. Top marine predators are likely to influence habitat by impacting ecological and environmental characteristics, abundance and distribution of prey and other resources, and presence of competitor species. Predators often have strong top-down effects on ecosystems and are considered a priority for conservation and management. With this study, the effects of top marine predators, such as sharks and Great Barracuda, on diversity and abundance of prey communities will be examined in putative low and high-risk areas around South Bimini, Bahamas. Baited remote underwater video surveys (BRUVs) will be deployed in South Biminiâ€™s habitat to capture predator-prey interactions. Abundance at each site is compared in order to determine if predator abundance effects prey abundance among different sites, in high and low risk environments, and in varying ocean conditions. Predator-prey interactions play a fundamental role in the behavior, ecology, and population biology of most taxa and are critical in community dynamics. Prey species will tolerate varying levels of predation risk depending on physical environmental factors, predator attributes, and prey condition (i.e. hunger state). A general baseline of predator and prey species will be established throughout the six months of observation between January- June 2018 and will be compiled in addition to previously gathered data. In areas of known high predation risk, it is predicted there will be a high abundance of predators and lower prey species diversity with higher rates of prey vigilance behaviors, and in areas of low risk, there will be higher abundance of prey than predators and prey will exhibit lower vigilance behaviors. Environmental factors such as location, temperature, and salinity are expected to play a role in the behavior between predator and prey.
